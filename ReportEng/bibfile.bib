abstract = {In this paper, two different approaches for modeling the behaviour of carbon nanotubes are presented. The first method models carbon nanotubes as an inhomogeneous cylindrical network shell using the asymptotic homogenization method. Explicit formulae are derived representing Young's and shear moduli of single-walled nanotubes in terms of pertinent material and geometric parameters. As an example, assuming certain values for these parameters, the Young's modulus was found to be 1.71 TPa, while the shear modulus was 0.32 TPa. The second method is based on finite element models. The inter-atomic interactions due to covalent and non-covalent bonds are replaced by beam and spring elements, respectively, in the structural model. Correlations between classical molecular mechanics and structural mechanics are used to effectively model the physics governing the nanotubes. Finite element models are developed for single-, double- and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. The deformations from the finite element simulations are subsequently used to predict the elastic and shear moduli of the nanotubes. The variation of mechanical properties with tube diameter is investigated for both zig-zag and armchair configurations. Furthermore, the dependence of mechanical properties on the number of nanotubules in multi-walled structures is also examined. Based on the finite element model, the value for the elastic modulus varied from 0.9 to 1.05 TPa for single and 1.32 to 1.58 TPa for double/multi-walled nanotubes. The shear modulus was found to vary from 0.14 to 0.47 TPa for single-walled nanotubes and 0.37 to 0.62 for double/multi-walled nanotubes. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Incremental sheet metal forming is a promising process providing a short and inexpensive way of forming products having a relatively simple but interesting shape. The paper presents the process controlled by CNC milling machine-tool together with CAD/CAM Master Cam system and a smooth forming tool. With experimental testing and measurements the limits of forming without a full-size model were defined. By using a simple full-size model and the concept where the sheet metal can move vertically in the clamping device, better results and products were obtained.},

Finite element (FE) models are established to simulate the process. Different FE packages have been used. Various aspects associated with the numerical choices as well as the material and process parameters have been studied. The final geometry and the reaction forces are presented as the results of the simulations. Comparison between the simulation results and the experimental data is also made.},

  abstract = {The recent trend towards the use of Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) as a novel construction material in mid- and high-rise buildings has steered the research efforts into this subject over the last few years. Despite the considerable progress made on the structural response of CLT, there are still several unresolved issues related to the analysis and design of CLT. This is of great interest for engineers and designers working on the mass timber construction sector. In particular, the buckling behaviour of CLT walls is a problem not fully understood to date. Therefore, in this paper we investigate the buckling capacity of CLT subject to compressive loads. In order to capture the heterogeneities present in wood, a multi-scale modelling strategy is adopted. To improve the numerical predictions, an optimisation-based parameter identification procedure is performed to calibrate the micromechanical parameters of wood. The numerical predictions are compared with experimental results and are validated successfully. The numerical model is then used to study the influence of the number of layers and wall openings on the buckling capacity of CLT walls.},
